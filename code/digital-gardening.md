## Status of pages

- Seedling: Rough drafts and early ideas. May change significantly and are likely just a brain dump
- Budding: Work which has been cleaned up and clarified
- Evergreen: Complete but may change some over time

> This freedom of course comes with great responsibility. Publishing imperfect and early ideas requires that we make the status of our notes clear to readers. You should include some indicator of how "done" they are, and how much effort you've invested in them.
