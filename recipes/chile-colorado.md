## Introduction

Chile colorado is great by itself, with fresh [flour tortillas](/recipes/flour-tortillas.md) or with a fried egg in the morning.

## Ingredients
- 6 cups of chicken stock
- 4 to 6 dried guajillo chiles, with stems removed
- 2 to 4 dried ancho or pasilla chiles, stems removed
- 2 to 3 pounds of pork sirloin, cut in 1 inch to 3/4 inch cubes
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 6 cloves of garlic, chopped
- 1 carrot, diced
- 2 teaspoons of cumin
- 1 teaspoon of dried *Mexican* oregano
- 1 teaspoon of ground *Mexican* cinnamon (canela)
- 3 bay leaves
- Canola oil
- Salt and pepper

## Equipment
- Sauce pan
- Dutch oven
- Vitamix/Blender
- Kitchen knife and cutting board
- Plastic wrap

## Instructions
- Bring two cups of chicken stock to a boil
- Toast the peppers
- Remove the chicken stock from the stove
- Add the pepper to the chicken stock and cover with plastic wrap
- Let peppers sit in the chicken stock covered for at least 30 minutes
- Season the pork chunks with salt and pepper
- Pre-heat the oven to 370 degrees Fahrenheit
- Heat two tablespoons of the canola oil in a large dutch oven or pot until shimmering
- Add the pork in batches to brown
- Once the pork as been browned, set it aside and add the onion, carrots, bell pepper to the pot and cook until it starts to soften.
- Stir frequently
- Add the garlic, cumin, oregano and cinnamon to the pot
- Optionally you can take the contents of the pot at this point and run it through the blender if you want a smother sauce.
- Add the pork and remaining chicken stock back to the pot
- Add the bay leaves
- Cover the dutch oven and put it in the oven for 2 to 2 and half hours
- At this point you should be able blend the peppers and their chicken stock until smooth
- Optionally run the mixture through a wire strainer for a smother sauce
- After about an hour of cooking I add the chile sauce to the dutch oven and stir
- Check the meat for tenderness at around 2 hours and adjust time as necessary

## Hints
- You can substitute fresh pablano for dried ancho. Just add with the onion and carrots.
- Serve with queso fresco and cilantro on top
- You can make enchilada sauce in advance and store in mason jars (fridge) and use instead of making the pepper mixture.
