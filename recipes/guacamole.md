## Ingredients
4 large avocados
1/2 red onion
3 to 4 serrano or 1 jalape√±o
1/2 bunch of cilantro (about 1 cup of leaves)
1 teaspoon of kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon of cumin
Juice of 1/2 a lime or as desired
1 diced tomato (optional)
Equipment
Bowl for guacamole
Kitchen knife
Fork for mashing
Cutting board

## Instructions
Slice chiles lengthwise and remove seeds
Mince chiles
Mince onion
Wash and dry cilantro, then remove leaves from stems
Chop cilantro leaves and discard stems
Add chiles, onion and cilantro to bowl
Wash your avocados
Slice avocados in half lengthwise and remove the seed
Scoop contents of avocado into bowl
Squeeze lime juice over avocados (helps prevents browning and adds flavor)
Mash avocados with fork
Add salt and cumin and stir to combine all ingredients
Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap
Press down on plastic wrap to remove as much air as possible
Refrigerate for at least an hour to let flavor develop

##Hints
Instead of mincing chiles, onion and cilantro as well as mashing avocados you can use a molcajete
Some people prefer using lemon instead of lime juice
Add chunked strawberry pieces when in season for a nice change
Air is your enemy and you should cover guacamole as tight as possible when storing for any length of time
