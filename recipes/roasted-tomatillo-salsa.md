I really like the acidic flavor of tomatillo. This roasted tomatillo salsa is excellent on pork carnitas. Tomatillo are generally available at most large grocery stores in the Southwestern United States.

## Ingredients
- 1 pound of tomatillo, husks removed and washed
- 1 sweet yellow onion sliced into 1/2” slices
- 3 cloves of unpeeled garlic
- 4 to 5 fresh serrano chiles
- 1 bunch of washed cilantro with large stems removed
- Canola oil spray
- 2 teaspoons of kosher salt

## Equipment
- Baking sheet
- Tin foil
- Gas grill or broiler
- Tongs
- Vitamix/blender

## Instructions
- Remove the husks from the tomatillo
- Wash the tomatillo. You will need to scrub them to get rid the the sticky sap
- Remove the stem and then cut the tomatillo into quarters
- Slice the onion into 1/2” slices
- Add the tomatillo, onion, serrano, and garlic to the tin foil lined baking sheet
- Spray with canola oil spray
- Roast turning occasionally until well blackened. You may need to remove the garlic before the rest of the items
- All the roasted items to cool
- Add everything to the blender and blend to your desired salsa consistency

## Hints
- This is a great salsa to have in the fridge. You can add it to most any meat dish or to the top of eggs.
