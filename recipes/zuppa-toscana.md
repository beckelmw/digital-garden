This olive garden copycat recipe is great with a nice salad.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound uncooked spicy Italian sausage, casings removed
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 4 cups (32 ounces) low-sodium chicken broth
- 3 large Russet potatoes (about 2 1/2 pounds total), cut in half, then cut into
  1/4-inch-thick half-moons
- 5 cups gently packed chopped curly kale leaves (from about 1/2 of a large
  bunch)
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving

## Instructions

- Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it
  up with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes.
- Add the onion and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and saut√© until
  softened, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth and potatoes and stir to
  combine. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer gently. Cover and cook
  until the potatoes are soft and falling apart, about 20 minutes.
- Stir in the kale and cook until the leaves are bright green and tender, about
  2 minutes. Stir in the cream, season with salt and pepper as needed, and
  serve, garnishing with Parmesan cheese.
