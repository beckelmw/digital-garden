This recipe is based on
https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-stir-fried-noodles-pad-see-ew/ with the
proportions changed a bit and some green onion added. I went with 2 *tablespoons* of everything in the sauce on accident and was very happy with the result. I think this makes for a simpler recipe with 2-2-2-2-2 for the dark and light soy sauce, oyster sauce, water and sugar. Keep in mind I used a high BTU burner outside with a wok so having a little extra liquid beyond the home kitchen recipe is probably not a bad idea.

I was able to purchase the Chinese brocoli (Kai Lan) along with the fresh rice noodles needed for this dish at [Lee Lee Asian market](http://leeleesupermarket.com/) in Tucson.

I was a little apprehensive about making the noodles based on reading the linked recipe, but they ended up being really easy with the microwave and separate technique.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh wide egg noodles
- 3 tablespoons high heat cooking oil (I used avocado)
- 2 cloves garlic cloves, very finely chopped
- 1 cup chicken breast sliced thin
- 1 large egg, pre-scrambled with a fork
- 6 stems Chinese broccoli with leaves (Sold as Kai Lan at Lee Lee)
- 3 to 4 green onions

### Sauce
- 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons all purpose soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons sugar (I used raw organic)
- 2 tablespoons water

## Instructions

### Preparation
- Chinese Broccoli – trim ends, cut into 3" pieces. Separate leaves from stems.
  Cut thick stems in half or quarters vertically. Keep separated.
- Green onions - slice white part and cut green parts into 1 to 2 inch pieces.
- Noodles – Put on plate and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave for 90 seconds and then carefully separate and recover.
- Sauce – Mix ingredients until sugar dissolves.

### Cooking
- Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in wok over high heat
- Add garlic, cook 15 seconds. Add chicken, cook until it mostly changes from pink to white.
- Add Chinese broccoli stems and white part of onions. Cook until chicken is almost cooked through.
- Add Chinese broccoli leaves and green part of onions and cook until just wilted.
- Push everything to one side and pour in scrambled egg and cook through while further scrambling.
- Remove everything in the wok to a bowl
- Return wok to stove, heat 2 tbsp oil over high heat until it starts smoking (HOT is key!). Add noodles and Sauce. Toss as few times as possible to disperse Sauce and make edges of noodles caramelize – about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.
- Quickly add chicken and vegetables back in, and toss to disperse. Serve immediately!
