This recipe is based on
https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-stir-fried-noodles-pad-see-ew/ with the
proportions changed a bit. I went with 2 _tablespoons_ of everything in the
sauce on accident and was very happy with the result. I think this makes for a
simpler recipe with 2-2-2-2-2 for the dark, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, water
and sugar being easy to remember. Keep in mind I use a high BTU burner outside
with a wok so having a little extra liquid beyond the home kitchen recipe is
probably not a bad idea.

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons all purpose soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons sugar (raw organic)
- 2 tablespoons water
- 3 tablespoons high heat cooking oil
- 2 cloves garlic cloves, very finely chopped
- 1 cup chicken breast
- 1 large egg
- 6 stems Chinese broccoli with leaves

## Instructions

- ### Preparation
- Chinese Broccoli – trim ends, cut into 3" pieces. Separate leaves from stems.
  Cut thick stems in half or quarters vertically
- Noodles – Put on plate and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave for 90 seconds
- Sauce – Mix ingredients until sugar dissolves.
-
- ### Cooking
- Heat oil: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wok over high heat.
- Cook garlic and chicken: Add garlic, cook 15 seconds. Add chicken, cook until
  it mostly changes from pink to white.
- Chinese broccoli STEMS: Add Chinese broccoli stems, cook until chicken is
  almost cooked through.
- Chinese broccoli LEAVES: Add Chinese broccoli leaves, cook until just wilted.
- Scramble egg: Push everything to one side, crack egg in and scramble.
- REMOVE chicken from wok: Remove everything in the wok onto a plate (scrape wok
  clean).
- Caramelise noodles: Return wok to stove, heat 2 tbsp oil over high heat until
  it starts smoking (HOT is key!). Add noodles and Sauce. Toss as few times as
  possible to disperse Sauce and make edges of noodles caramelise – about 1 to 1
  1/2 minutes.
- Add chicken back in: Quickly add chicken and veg back in, and toss to
  disperse. Serve immediately!
