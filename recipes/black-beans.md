Chipotle copycat black bean recipe from
https://thecarefreekitchen.com/chipotle-black-beans-copycat-recipe/

## Ingredients

- 1 lb Dried Black Beans or 4 cans black beans
- Water only necessary if using dry beans
- 2 tablespoons Avocado Oil
- 2 cups Onions white or yellow, diced
- 6 cloves Garlic minced (about 2 tablespoons)
- 1 tsp Dried Oregano
- 1 tsp Chili Powder
- 1 pinch Cayenne Pepper
- 1 tsp Cumin
- 2 tsp Salt
- 2 large Bay Leaves
- 1 medium Lime juiced, for serving

## Instructions

- Pour dried beans into a large bowl and sort out the broken beans. Rinse, drain
  and add to a large pot. Cover with cool water about 1" above the beans. Place
  a lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for about 2
  hours, or until the beans are soft. (Note: if using canned beans, you can skip
  this step)
- In a large pot, add the avocado oil and heat over medium heat. Add the minced
  onions and saut√© until golden brown, or about 5-7 minutes. Add minced garlic
  and cook until garlic is soft and tender, or about 2 more minutes.
- Next, add in the cooked (or canned) black beans, oregano, chili powder,
  cayenne pepper, cumin, salt and a bay leaf or two. Add water until the beans
  are barely covered and continue to cook on medium heat for 30 minutes, or
  until most of the water has evaporated and beans are tender.
- Remove from the heat and remove the bay leaves. Squeeze lime juice into the
  beans and serve immediately as a side dish or in burritos, tacos, quesadillas,
  salads or nachos. Enjoy!
