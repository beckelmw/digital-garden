I've always liked Italian sausage. I found this recipe for making my own that has worked out great. I often double the recipe below and freeze it in multiple 1 to 1.5 lb logs for later use.

## Ingredients

- 3 pounds ground pork (see hints)
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon salt (kosher)
- 1 tablespoon fresh black pepper
- 1 1/4 tablespoon dried parsley
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 tablespoon fennel seeds
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

## Instructions

- Place the pork and red wine vinegar in a mixing bowl
- Add all of the spices
- Kneed until well combined
- Form the sausage into logs
- Wrap the logs tightly in plastic wrap
- Store the wrapped logs in a large freezer bag
- Refrigerate for at least 12 hours before use or freeze for later

## Equipment

- Large mixing bowl
- Plastic wrap
- Gallon freezer bags
- Kitchen knife and cutting board if chopping meat
- Measuring spoons

## Hints

- I like the consistency of chopped meat for this sausage. You don't need to get it pre-ground or even use a grinder. You can instead chop it by hand.
- I buy large pork butts when they are on sale. I cut them into smaller chunks prior to freezing them for later use. I then take the smaller chunks out of the freezer and chop them while they are still mostly frozen.
- 2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper is fairly mild. I like to add more when I am cooking depending up on the dish.
