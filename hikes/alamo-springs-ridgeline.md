This [loop trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/arizona/wild-mustang-to-wild-burro-to-ridgeline-to-alamo-springs) is part of the system behind the Tucson Ritz Carlton in the Tortolita Mountains.

I did 13.8 miles of this 15.4 mile loop on a cool January morning. Found a crested sahuaro near the east end of the loop. I saw nine mountain bikers and zero hikers in the first 10 miles due to the early start. I finally saw some hikers coming the opposite direction on the loop once I was down in a more travelled part of the trail system.
