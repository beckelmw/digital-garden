Today, I fly for fun. It takes a lot of study to stay current and proficient. Here are some of the resources I have found helpful to do so.

A bit of background. Today I mostly fly a Beechcraft V35B Bonanza, which is a high performance/complex single-engine airplane.

## Training providers

- [Pilot workshops](https://pilotworkshop.com/). They have quite a few different courses. I especially like their [IFR Mastery](https://pilotworkshop.com/products/ifr-mastery/) and [IFR The missing lesson](https://pilotworkshop.com/products/ifr-missing-lessons/) courses.
- [Sporty's all access training videos](https://generalaviationnews.com/2018/03/28/sportys-launches-all-access-membership/)

## Aviation podcasts

- [Aviation news talk](https://aviationnewstalk.com/)
- [Podcasting on a plane](https://www.podcastingonaplane.com/)
- [Simple flight radio](http://www.simpleflight.net/)

## YouTube channels

- [Martin Pauly](https://www.youtube.com/user/martinpauly)
- [Matt Guthmiller](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_YMUUbonlfzhah0HW4xGGg)

## Associations

- [American Bonanza Society](https://www.bonanza.org/) (ABS) has some quality online training content as well as links to all the Bonanza pilot operating handbooks (POHs) and online forum. It is a yearly or lifetime membership, but well worth it for the online training content alone.
